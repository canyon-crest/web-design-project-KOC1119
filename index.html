<h3>Mountain Biking: </h3>
<p><img src="images/carson-rampage1.jpg" id="pic1">I only started <a href="https://www.scott-sports.com/us/en/gambler"target="_blank">mountain biking</a> recently, and at first, it was really hard. I kept losing balance and struggled to climb steep trails. But each time I rode, I learned something new - how to shift gears better, how to handle turns, and even some terminology such as <span>“steez”. Now I feel more confident in sending 30 foot gaps and going 50 kmph downhill, on a muddy trail. I have yet to land a triple backflip but am enjoying every second of the journey to reach that goal. </p>

<h3>Sneaker Era:</h3>
<p><img src="images/Modern Sneakerhead_PIC_7.jpeg"id="pic2">Way back in my middle school days, I had an obsession over sneakers. The shapes, the curves, and all the features were unique to each and every pair. This diversity forced brand competition and created even more unique, fun pairs. Sadly, these shoes were costing upwards of $200 dollars on average, creating a barrier that a 12 year old child could not overcome. I was able to obtain a pair of <a href="https://www.nike.com/ca/launch/t/air-jordan-4-red-cement"target="_blank">jordan 4s</a> for retail which was still at the steep price of $240. </p>

<h3>Zoom Machines:</h3>
<p><img src="images/718484.avif" id="pic3">Cars have not interested me until recently. When I got into mountain bikes, I had seen people working on their bikes which seemed very interesting. As I looked into mechanics, I had also seen the content of cars and the <a href="https://www.ford.com/performance/gt/" target="_blank">beauty behind the mechanics of every car.</a> As I went into the rabbit hole, I found more and more cars with increasingly impressive features. Commuters, supercars, and hypercars; all were impressive in their own ways. As I looked into the cars, I came to see the components and was mesmerized by the engine and shell. How cars are holding a hunk of metal in their chassis. Very interesting. </p>
